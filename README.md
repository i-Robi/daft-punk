# draft-punk
Interactive version of Daft Punk's *Lose Yourself To Dance* â€” **that's a draft!**

Based on an original idea by [Norbert Schnell](mailto:Norbert.Schnell@ircam.fr), made with technologies developed at [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr).

## Future improvements
- Block content on non-mobile devices **OR** create secondary interaction with finger / mouse
- Display a loading message while files are loading
- Stop `PlayControl` when the backtrack reaches the end
